        <h3>My Path to Becoming a Developer</h3>
        <p>If you have seen my resume, you know that I have had an interesting and varied work life. Most of my 
        employment experience centered around being able to raise my family. In fact, getting a job in a church 
        school is how I ended up studying software development. You may be thinking, "Wait! What?" I will explain. </p>
        <p>My son has autism--a particularly challenging developmental disorder. Families who have children
        with autism spend a lot of time helping that individual find a niche in the world. So when I looked 
        for work, I always sought job opportunities where I could be nearby. At one point in his school life, 
        he was being bullied. Through luck and grace, I was able to move him to a private school. The school 
        had a church, and I was hired as the office manager. So how did that get me into development? Well,
        non-profits rely heavily on volunteers. When one of the volunteer web designers quit, the job was
        assigned to me. At that point, I could barely read HTML, so I went back to college.</p>

        <p>I had always been interested in applications where technology and creativity meet, so I decided to 
        study web design and programming.  My first teacher, who taught Python, encouraged me to study software 
        development, and from that moment I pursued and received a degree in IT and Management.</p>
